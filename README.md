03/05/2021: From the tried classifiers, it seems that the draws are truly random, and a pattern cannot be found by the following classifiers:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbours

All of the above classifiers yield an accuracy of 0.0.

06/05/2021: After trying several other classifiers, it appears there is no pattern to how lottery numbers are drawn. A different approach using a Neural Net or clustering can be considered for future experimentation.
